# iBand Security Policy

iBand is designed as a **global social platform** where safety is always balanced with accessibility.  
Our guiding principle: **“Frictionless for fans & artists, invisible tripwires for bad actors.”**

---

## 🔐 Authentication & Identity
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**  
  - Fans and artists can enable 2-step verification.  
  - Options: SMS code, authenticator app, email fallback.  
  - High-risk logins may require step-up MFA automatically.

- **Biometric Support**  
  - Where devices allow, login via Face ID / Touch ID / fingerprint.  
  - Adds convenience and prevents account takeover.

---

## 🌍 IP & Device Intelligence
- **Device Fingerprinting**: Each login is checked against known device/browser patterns.  
- **IP Reputation Check**: Suspicious or flagged IP ranges trigger extra verification.  
- **Geo Matching**: Mobile number country and IP country are compared.  
  - If mismatch is normal (traveling), access is granted but MFA required.  
  - If mismatch is unusual (fraud rings, farms), account flagged for review.  
- **VPNs**: Allowed for privacy, but high-risk VPNs (shared datacenter exit nodes) trigger MFA.

---

## 🛡️ Anti-Abuse Measures
- **Rate Limiting**: Brute force login attempts blocked automatically.  
- **Bot Detection**: Suspicious signups filtered with invisible captchas and velocity checks.  
- **Account Linking**: Fraudulent clusters (shared devices, repeated IP ranges) flagged.  
- **Self-Monitoring Backend**:  
  - Crash watchdog + auto-restart.  
  - Error telemetry reports anomalies.  
  - Automated health checks and self-healing.

---

## 🚨 Panic Button & Safety
- Fans/artists can press a **panic button** in-app if they are being:  
  - Harassed, threatened, or exploited.  
  - The panic event **logs the account, session, IP, and chat history**, freezing abuse in real-time.  
- Alerts sent to:  
  - iBand Safety Team (24/7 monitoring).  
  - If required by local law, forwarded to cyber policing agencies.  

---

## 🌐 Global Rules & Content Compliance
- **Country-Specific Rules**: Content is filtered to match local laws (music rights, explicit content, etc.).  
- **Common Language**: English is the global default, but local categories/genres are preserved.  
- **Fan Choice**: Users may mix & match — explore only English genres, only local genres, or both.  
- **Slogan for Fans**: *“ITS ALWAYS YOUR CHOICE.”*

---

## 🧾 User Experience Promise
- 95% of users never notice security — the system runs invisibly.  
- Extra checks appear only when risk is detected.  
- Security is always designed to **protect without blocking creativity**.
